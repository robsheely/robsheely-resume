# Rob Sheely Resume React Project

As an exercise I created a project with an api and a client. It demonstrates my ability to use the following technologies:

- React
- Material UI
- GraphQL
- Apollo Client
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- npm/yarn
- webpack/babel

The client consumes and displays the data from the node/express/graphQL api. It also allows you to add a new position through a simple edit form.

To run:
- Clone this project
- In the cloned project directory enter: ```yarn start```

NOTE: A PDF version of my resume is included at root level.
